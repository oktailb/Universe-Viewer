FRAMEWORK FOR COSMOGRAPHY AT HIGH REDSHIFT

Abstract
We propose a geometrical framework which is adapted for the investigation of 
Large Scales Structures at high redshifts in curved spaces, within the Standard
world model of Universe. It is based on the embedding of the comoving space
onto the 4D metric space, which provides us with a useful
algebra-representation of objects positions in space. In particular, the
interpretation and the calculation of geometrical quantities, such as distances
between objects, angles, surfaces and volumes, become obvious. Moreover,
elements of cartography provides us with global view of the Universe which
accounts for the curvature. A quasars catalog is used for having a visual
support. This framework is implemented in a free-share routine called {\em
Universe Viewer} which is accessible at {\bf cpt.univ-mrs.fr/cosmology/UV}.

Initial project started by R. TRIAY, S. SPINELLI, R. LAFAYE
October 1995
CPT-94/P.3138

Project restarted in 2003 by R. TRIAY, V. LECOQ, X. LAUGIER
Java Version released in 2008 by M. ABATI, J. FONTAINE

I still want to modernize this project and add new features like as correction of light distortion due to gravity
