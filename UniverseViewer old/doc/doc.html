<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">    0/PREFACE.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">      This software was conceived within the framework of a data-processing project being part of the formation of Physical DEA the &quot;of the particles, Mathematical physics and Mod?lisation&quot; of the faculty of Aix-Marseilles II.  This project was realis? in three months and could not be the subject of a thorough research of the errors.  We thus hope for all your indulgence if, as it is extremely probable, from the errors come to disturb your work.  We also hope that this program will be useful for you and effective object of work.  Programmers:  Remi Lafaye and Lionel Spinelli.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">      I/PRONE OF The PROGRAM:  PRESENTATION AND GOALS.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">        Thanks to the observations of the universe on the great scales, the astronomers could note that the large objects (galaxies, quasars...) were distributed of structures called cluster.  The fact that their distribution is not homogeneous, as one believed in the beginning, encourages has to seek the causes of this inhomog?ne?te and the effects that that can have on the models of universe which one connait (assertion, invalidation).  For that, the astronomers need a tool allowing to locate them the great structures in the space time, to see the evolution of these structures according to the various cosmological models and to have access has precise information on the possible existence and the consequences of these models.  It is has this end which UV has ete concu.  It gives access to projections of the structures on six plans of the space time like year several graphs and functions making it possible to analyze the data obtained.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">	II/POSSIBILITIES OF UV.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">	II.1/ANALYSIS OF THE DATA.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">	 UV as follows works on an ASCII data file formate:  Ascenscion droite(a) Declinaison(delta) Redshiftd(z) In the current version, this file is the catalogue of quasars creates by Burbridge.  thanks to the cosmological constants lambda, Omega, K, alpha (which are bound by the relation:  lambda+Omega-k+alpha=1), UV calculates the position of each quasar in space has four dimensions.  This calculation is done via the distance comobile tau(z):  tau(z) = sqrt{k } _ * integrale(dR/sqrt(P(R))) on [ 1/1+z, 1 ] with P(R) = lambda*R^4+Omega*R^2-k*R+alpha</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">	 II.2/PROJECTION IN 6 SIGHTS.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">	   Thanks to preceding calculations, UV projects the quasars on the definis plans by the base (P, Q, R, T) or (P, Q, R) is a base of space and T the vector defining the fourth dimension, time.  By convention, the Earth is the vector (0,0,0,1)=T (the age of the universe is has our time standardizes has 1).  6 sights thus are obtained:  - 3 of them are sights implying the vector T One names them front view or &quot;face views&quot;.  - 3 others are the Euclidean sights.  They are named seen profile or &quot;edge views&quot;.  The speed of ?xecution of UV allows an animation in time r??l of the continuous variation of the cosmological constants.  This animation is done in the principal window.  Moreover, in order to be able to observe the sky in all the directions, the space base (P, Q, R) is built as follows:  That is to say E=(e1, e2, e3) the canonical base of space, one takes E' =(e1 ', e2 ', e3 ') the isomorphous base has E or e_1 ' has the co-ordinates spherical (has, delta) in E One then builds E' ' =(e1 ', e2 '', e3 ' ') with e2 '' and e3 '' which is the images of e2 ' and e3 ' in the rotation of angle beta around e1 '.  It is written whereas (P, Q, R)=(e1 ', e2 '', e3 ' '). the user has the possibility of varying continuement the terms has, delta, beta what enables him to see space in all the directions.  Still, animation is done in time r??l.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">	   II.3/Given ADDITIONAL.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">	     In addition to preceding projections, UV gives access has several functions, thus bringing additional information.  SECONDARY</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">	     II.3.1/WINDOWS OF PROJECTION</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">	     .  As we saw pr?cedemment, UV projects the space time on 6 sights.  Each one of these sights can be observed one after the other in the principal window.  So that the user can perceive the structures in the space time, UV makes it possible to open a maximum of six secondary windows containing each one one of six projections.  Animations in time r??l of the continuous variations of the parameters are then applied has these windows.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">	     II.3.2/R=f(t) GRAPH.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">	      One designe by R dimension characteristic of the universe, and per T time.  This graph gives the curve of variation of R according to time as well as the age of the universe has our time (or R east standardizes has 1).  In fact, one calculates T according to R grace has the formula:  t(R) = integrale(r.dr/sqrt(P(r))) out of [ 0, R ].  Let us note that there too, UV allows animation in time r??l continuous variations of the cosmological parameters.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">	      II.3.3/GRAPH 1/sqrt(P(R)).</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">	        This graph is that of the function:  R --&gt; 1/sqrt(P(R)) which is the function integrande in the calculation of the distance comobile, to see figure \ref{PdeR }.  Still, UV gives access has animation in time r??l continuous variations of the cosmological parameters.  This makes it possible to see the evolution of the integrande and thus of rep?rer the singularities to come.  II.3.4/GRAPH tau(z).  This graph makes it possible to visualize the distance comobile quasars according to their redshift according to the cosmological model gives.  The animation of the continuous variations of the cosmological parameters is done in time r??l.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">		II.3.5/GRAPH lambda vs Omega.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">		This graph is most interesting of all.  It comprises several curves which allow has the user to select a cosmological model by taking account of constraints that it is fixed or that fixed physics.  The graph contains:  1 the line k=0 corresponding to the universes has null curve.  2 the limiting curve beyond which the universe is known as bounced.  3 the curve of constant age in two parts, it fixes the area or the universe has an age ranging between the limits posted with the top of the graph and that the user can modify within the limits of the reasonable one.  4 the curve of the number of causal cells constant.  The value can be fixed by the user.  Moreover, by choice of the model on this graph, UV the number of causal cells calculates corresponding to that the model.  Caution:  this graph requires calculations ?normement.  As, it is extremely probable as its time of appearance reaches the 50 seconds or more, according to your information processing system.  Note:  the graph east recomputes only if the values corresponding to the curves are changed.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">		ISOTROPIC II.3.6/SIMULATION.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">		This simulation was developed in order to allow has the user to have the best seen on the effects of distortion due to the cosmological models.  This option creates a whole of quasars places isotropic manner compared to the model chosen, in a cone of sight predetermine.  The user can then use all the options of UV in order to treat has his ease this simulation.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">		III/USE OF UV.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">		  III.1/SEEN GENERAL OF The INTERFACE.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">		    The window of UV breaks up into 3 parts:  1 the chart window or is represented the projection of the universe according to the cosmological constants and the selected vectors of projection.  the 2 control knobs which make it possible to adjust the values of the cosmological constants and the co-ordinates of the vectors of projection.  3 the menu which gives access to the other options of the program.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">		    III.2/ERRORS</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">		    .  When occurs a r?cuperable error during the execution of the program, one limps of dialogue informed the user of the nature of the error.  The errors are mainly following types:  1 Errors of file if the selected file does not exist or is not with the awaited format.  2 numerical Miscalculations if the values of the cosmological constants give noncalculable expressions by the algorithms used.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">		    III.3/LOADING Of A DATA FILE.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">		      By defect with demarage UV seeks the file &quot;/Data/Burbridge.txt&quot;;  if it finds it no data is not charged.  To open to a new data file one utlise the &quot;open&quot; option of the menu &quot;slips by&quot;, one limps of selection of file opens then and waits until the utlisator specifie a file name.  The program seeks the file then and if an error occurs, one limps of alarm is posted.  Caution:  the loading of a file can take ten seconds.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">		      III.4/CHOICE OF THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANTS.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">		        There are two manners of selecting the values of the cosmological constants.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			III.4.1/IN THE PRINCIPAL WINDOW.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			  In high A left of the principal window the gadgets of modification of the cosmological constants are located, they break up into three parts:  1 the pushbuttons:  only one A the time can be engaged, it designe then the value fixed by the three others according to the relation:  lambda + Omega - K + alpha = 1 2/values of the constants which can be published directly from the keyboard.  Caution:  to always support on RETURN after entry of a data if not the value will not be seized.  the 3 fleches which decrease &quot;&lt;&quot; or increase &quot;&gt;&quot; the corresponding constant of a fixed value (reglable).</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			  III.4.2/Using the GRAPH lambda vs Omega</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			  .  In the menu &quot;graphics&quot;, the option &quot;lambda vs Omega&quot; reveals a graph giving the areas of the plan (lambda, Omega) according to the models of universe.  The button &quot;select has model&quot; then makes it possible to choose a model by clicking a point of the graph with the mouse.  This determines Omega and lambda what gives a model grace has the fixed value of alpha and has the relation which binds the cosmological constant quatres.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			  III.5/CHOICE OF PROJECTION.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			  III.5.1/THE REP?RE OF PROJECTION</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			  .  As we described pr?c?dement, the base of projection is built so as to be related to 3 parameters:  1 A, the right ascension of the 1st vector.  2 delta, the variation of the 1st vector.  3 beta, the angle swing of the isomorphous base around the 1st vector.  These three parameters can be exchanges, either in manner continues by the fleches &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; corresponding, or directly while acting on the field text adapts (Attention always to make RETURN).</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			  III.5.2/THE ZOOM</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			  .  UV makes it possible to increase part of the principal window.  This function Zoom possede several options:  - Center:  place the center of the zone increased at the pointselectionne by the mouse.  - (0,0):  place the center of the increased zone has the origin of the rep?re.  - Earth:  place the center of the zone increased on the ground.  - Zoom +:  increased the zone of a factor.  - Zoom -:  reduit the zone of a factor.  - * 1:  ramene the zone has its dimension of origin.  - Localize Zoom:  indicate the zone increased by a cross-section of color on the principal window like on the active secondary windows.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			   III.5.3/VARIOUS SIGHTS</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			   .  UV gives access has 6 different sights.  Each one of it can be observed on the window principal grace has bars-finely it located at the top of the zoom.  UV also makes it possible to visualize them on external secondary windows.  With this intention, it is enough to select the sight on the menu &quot;views&quot;.  Not to make to useless calculations the user must to close the secondary windows to use the button &quot;closed&quot;.  The still active windows are specifi?es in the menu &quot;views&quot; by a pushbutton engages, they can then be desactiv?es by selectionnant them has new in the menu.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			   III.6/OTHER TOOLS</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			   III.6.1/CALCULATION OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			   .  UV allows the calculation of the distance between two objects.  To be done, it is enough to select &quot;Distance&quot; in the menu &quot;tools&quot;, then to choose two points grace the mouse after having to click the button &quot;choose has&quot; corresponding.  If the program finds a point corresponding a data it has surrounds it by a cross-section of color, if not a message of alarm is posted requiring has the user to make another choice.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			   III.6.2/VARIOUS GRAPHS.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			     As we saw previously, UV gives access has several graphs of complementary data.  These graphs are:  - the graph of the evolution of the age of the universe.  - the graph of the function has to integrate for the calculation of the distance commobile.  - the graph of the distance commobile.  - the graph of selection of the cosmological model.  All these graphs are accessible in small &quot;the Graphics&quot;.  Not to make to useless calculations the user must to close the secondary windows to use the button &quot;closed&quot;.  The still active windows are specifi?es in the menu &quot;views&quot; by an engaged pushbutton, they can then be desactiv?es by selectionnant them has new in the menu.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			     III.6.3/ISOTROPIC SIMULATION</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			     .  This simulation is accessible by small &quot;the Tools&quot;.  With the opening, UV considere the cosmological model selected in the principal window and requires:  - the number of quasars desir?.  - the minimal volume reached by the quasars.  - the maximum volume reached by the quasars.  - the right ascension of the principal axis of sight.  - the variation of the principal axis of sight.  - the half angle of opening of the cone of observation.  Once the entered data, UV proced? with usual calculations and behaves then as with any other data file.</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			     III.6.4/PREFERENCES</p>
<p class="Standard" style="text-align:left; ">			     .  Small &quot;the Pr?ferences&quot; gives access a:  - &quot;Calculus&quot; which makes it possible to vary the data used in calculation of the abacus of integration.  - &quot;Arrows&quot; which makes it possible to change the step of continuous variation of the cosmological constants and the angles of the rep?re.  - &quot;Options&quot; which makes it possible to pass from degrees in radians and to modify the number of treated data.</p>
